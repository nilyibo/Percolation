## Epidemic Graph

### Introduction

Epidemic Graph is an interactive graph modeling the spread of epidemics.

### Detailed information

In Epidemic Graph, each node is a person who may or may not be infected. Each edge means a connection between two people.

Initially, you can set some people to be infected. Once started, in each round, infection spreads as follow: For each person, if the number of infected neighbors is greater than or equal to the preset threshold, then the person becomes infected.

Simulation will stop when there are no more changes in infected people.
